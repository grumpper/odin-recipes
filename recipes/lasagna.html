    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> - This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean
            ground beef.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong> - An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with
            the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products</strong> - You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
            tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance
            the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong> - This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
            parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> - Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong> - Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
            extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> - An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
            lasagna when you cut into it.
        </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
