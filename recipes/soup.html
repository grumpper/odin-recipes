            The BEST chicken soup you'll ever eat is the perfect recipe to make when you're feeling
            sick.
            Packed with anti-inflammatory ingredients like ginger, turmeric, garlic.
            This is the BEST CHICKEN SOUP RECIPE EVER!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ginger</strong> - Great for digestion and a powerful anti-inflammatory agent
                to
                use in recipes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Truly the best when you're sick. Garlic is full of
                anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. That's why we use 6 cloves of
                garlic in
                this soup. That's right, you're going to sick this cold's ass.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Turmeric</strong> - Super trendy and very good for you. Best when consumed
                with
                a black pepper to help for optimal absorption. This recipe calls for fresh turmeric
                (if
                you can find it).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - We're packing' this recipe with protein too â€” and guess
                what?
                The chicken actually cooks in the soup broth, leaving it tender and making it easy
                for
                you!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong> - Rosemary & thyme add additional flavor in this
                recipe.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pearl (or Israeli) Couscous</strong> - Besides the veggies, the couscous is
                really the star because it helps to thicken the broth and keep the soup hearty.
                You'll
                want to use pearl couscous (also labeled Israeli couscous in stores) in the recipe.
                It
                just provides the perfect texture for the soup.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large dutch oven or pot over medium high heat and add in oil. Once oil is
                hot,
                add in garlic, onion, carrots and celery; cook for a few minutes until onion becomes
                translucent.
            </li>
            <li>Next add in grated ginger and grated turmeric. Saute for 30 seconds to let the
                spices
                cook a bit, then add in chicken broth, chicken breast, rosemary, thyme, salt and
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Bring soup to a boil, then stir in couscous. You'll want the chicken to be covered
                by
                the broth so make sure you stir them down to the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is
                fully cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board
                to
                shred with two forks. Add chicken back to pot then stir in frozen peas. If you find
                that
                you don't have enough broth, feel free to add in another cup. Everyone likes their
                soup
                differently. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Enjoy.

        </ol>
