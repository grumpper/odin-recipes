    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Caesar salad recipe is guaranteed to impress dinner party guests! 
        It's topped with homemade croutons, crisp veggies, and a rich, tangy dressing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Romaine lettuce</b> - Chop it into bite-sized pieces that'll mingle with the other ingredients! You don’t want any big chunks of romaine here. Butterhead lettuce would be delicious in this recipe as well.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese</b> - I like to scatter shaved pecorino cheese over my Caesar salad, but a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese would add the same nutty, savory flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Homemade croutons</b> - For crunch! These are so yummy and easy to make – just toss bread cubes with olive oil and salt, spread them on a baking sheet, and toast them in a 350-degree oven until they’re golden brown.</li>
            <li><b>Caesar dressing</b> - Traditional Caesar salad dressing is made with raw egg yolks, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies, but my version is much simpler and just as good. In a small bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, a minced garlic clove and capers, Dijon mustard, and black pepper. You’ll end up with a creamy, rich mixture that tastes every bit as tangy and savory as the classic version.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        To make this recipe extra fresh, I add a few unconventional components to the classic 
        Caesar salad template. First, I pile on a generous amount of roasted chickpeas. 
        They add protein to this recipe, along with lots of extra crunch. Finally, shaved 
        red radishes, pine nuts, and a sprinkle of chives take the whole thing over the top.
