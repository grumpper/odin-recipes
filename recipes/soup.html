    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ginger</b> - Great for digestion and a powerful anti-inflammatory agent to use in recipes.</li>
            <li><b>Garlic</b> - Truly the best when you're sick. Garlic is full of anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. That's why we use 6 cloves of garlic in this soup. That's right, you're going to sick this cold's ass.</li>
            <li><b>Turmeric</b> - Super trendy and very good for you. Best when consumed with a black pepper to help for optimal absorption. This recipe calls for fresh turmeric (if you can find it).</li>
            <li><b>Chicken</b> - We're packin' this recipe with protein too â€” and guess what? The chicken actually cooks in the soup broth, leaving it tender and making it easy for you!</li>
            <li><b>Fresh herbs</b> - Rosemary & thyme add additional flavor in this recipe.</li>
            <li><b>Pearl (or Israeli) Couscous</b> - Besides the veggies, the couscous is really the star because it helps to thicken the broth and keep the soup hearty. You'll want to use pearl couscous (also labeled Israeli couscous in stores) in the recipe. It just provides the perfect texture for the soup.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large dutch oven or pot over medium high heat and add in oil. Once oil is hot, add in garlic, onion, carrots and celery; cook for a few minutes until onion becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>Next add in grated ginger and grated turmeric. Saute for 30 seconds to let the spices cook a bit, then add in chicken broth, chicken breast, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring soup to a boil, then stir in couscous. You'll want the chicken to be covered by the broth so make sure you stir them down to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board to shred with two forks. Add chicken back to pot then stir in frozen peas. If you find that you don't have enough broth, feel free to add in another cup. Everyone likes their soup differently. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Enjoy.</li>
